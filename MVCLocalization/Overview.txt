Spring MVC project with xml configuration

Change of language via internationalization. 

The change of language was not done via request. But from the xml value. 

Need to convert it to springboot project

Solved:
To make the project run added embeded tomcat in pom 
Then added maven in add configuration. used command tomcat7:run

got error during redirect

Move

<mvc:annotation-driven />
to your servlet context configuration. Since it's absent, Spring's DispatcherServlet uses its default configuration, which uses the deprecated AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter instead of the more sophisticated RequestMappingHandlerAdapter.

Also,

<context:component-scan base-package="com.vc.teacher" />
is a superset of

<context:component-scan base-package="com.vc.teacher.controller" />
So you will have duplicate bean definitions for any beans under com.vc.teacher.controller. Fix that by making your component scans distinct.
